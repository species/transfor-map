Done:
• icons © greenmap -OK
• permalinks ~OK done with hash in browser url.
• "fork me at github"-badge -OK
• Search box (for e.g. jump to location)
  http://mapbbcode.org/leaflet.html very primitive, but works - takes first Nominatim hit, no possibility to choose :-/
  https://github.com/smeijer/L.GeoSearch Demo not working, have to try
  Overpass Turbo implementation: - dunno from where he has ist, seems to be copied.
  http://labs.easyblog.it/maps/leaflet-search/examples/nominatim.html - good looking and functionality, but: hangs on map load, BG map displayed and pannable only after some time :-/
    -OK fixed with resorting to add search code at last
• 'Locate me' button instead of automatic geolocation on load
  https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-locatecontrol doesn't work with latest jquery and leaflet
    try to rewrite to version with minimal function. -OK
• adding POIs from overpass to marker layer with bulk methods -OK
• Display coordinates -OK
• "loading" - indicator for node/way/relations -OK
• fix loading of Graz POIs at start -OK
• "Download this data" - Link (Overpass-Export)
• edit in JOSM / iD -Link
• LEGEND for Icons!
• The Current Map has to be named in the Header! -> OK sidebar
• maxzoom up to 19 -OK


github issues
• opening_hours support  (is it open now?)
• in Popup „Route here“ with link to OSRM
• popup language translation
• popup links to tags (to osm-wiki - what does this tag mean?)
• statistics: how many POIs loaded (like overpass-turbo)
• display image (from wikipedia or "image="-Tag
• addresses: show street if member of associatedStreet Relation
• icons: rewrite to have all in one file (less http requests)
• markers: implement retina using property iconRetinaUrl (iconsize * 2) 

Todo:
• layers with different needs
    1st step: layer checkbox(es) in layer-menu -OK
    2nd step: more layers (different overpass-queries)
      question: 
        ? one query, and sort into different layers → goal should be to reduce queries
        ? more queries, and feed each into its own layer?
      ? what if an object belongs to more than one layer?
      ? how to do clustering?
        must be done over ALL layers → only one layer possible!
        → we cannot use Leaflet layer switcher 
        → must use MarkerCluster function!
          removeLayers is too slow when bulk removing
          → clearLayers then addLayers

    3rd step: generate overpass-queries from taxonomy.json


• different icon-sets for the distinct maps -OK
  base-folder for each map
    pois
    needs
    identities
    interaction
    freemap -> pois?
    greenmap -> pois?
    organic -OK
      pois, but with colors:
        only: green
        yes: yellow
        limited: orange
      or background or bg-image?
        
    
• fixed worldwide clusters for z=0-12! (download daily via script to server)
  ~OK done for identities + needs

Performance:
• reduce queries to Overpass-Server
  · when zooming in below 12, do not query -OK
  · keep (how?) a "List" of visited places, and do not query if we were already there
  · At first, download nodes, then ways, then rels (should speed up display significantly) -OK
  -> different types to different servers -OK
    Todo: check ways in rels, nodes working -OK



clustering
  Leaflet.markercluster -OK
  TODO: 
    • generic icons for clusters
    -> better clusters
    
translations via transifex
    how to fetch translations? should be fetched realtime (at loading of website)
    implement API (at first via sourced JSON file)


todo: on transformap.co not ONE map, but many .... tiled 'previews' n' with link to distinct maps
	* Organic map -OK
	* Regional map -OK
	* Gratis-map
	* Needs-karte
	* Political Map -OK
	* fairtrade-Map -OK
	* garden-map
	* ...

Sidebar toggle button:
    display “Menu” or something when hidden

FIXME
  POIs doesn't work with IE8 on WinXP
  Mobile: some icons scale in FF (layers, +/-, locate)
    others not (edit, search)

Every IMPORTANT Feature has to have text&icon!
    Other Maps (how to call it? "Other Maps" "Maps" "Explore Maps" "Different Maps" "More Maps"
    Edit 

Think of Mobile! They CANNOT hover for more information!

Filters:
    must be deactivated on default: Button "Enable Filters"
        because: at 20 Needs, 20 checked boxes confuse users
    must be taken into account in URL (for sharing)
        display amount of items right of filter! (e.g. you see that you can filter out all 427 trees)
    on EVERY Map provide filters for our 3 categories!
        so you can filter on the organic map to deactivate buying_selling! - then you should see all "alternative" POIs

feedback user-test:
    dass die "6" die Anzahl der Punkte ist, ist nicht intuitiv
    Hover-Effekt muss sowohl bei POIs als auch bei Clustern gehn -OK
    zoom bei cluster auflösen zu schnell, man sieht nicht dass die Karte reinzoomt
